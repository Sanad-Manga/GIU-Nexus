## Features

- **Auth** — Register, login, logout with JWT. Forgot password via OTP email (Nodemailer). JWT blacklisting on logout.
- **Role-based access** — Job Seeker, Recruiter, Admin with route-level authorization.
- **Recruiter approval** — Recruiters start as `pending` and must be approved by an admin before posting jobs.
- **Jobs** — Create, filter, update, delete. AI auto-assigns category (HuggingFace zero-shot classification). Save/unsave jobs.
- **Applications** — Apply to jobs, track status (pending → shortlisted / rejected). Recruiters manage applicants per job.
- **Profile** — View and update profile. AI extracts skills from bio (HuggingFace NER). Profile picture upload via Cloudinary.
- **Recommendations** — AI-powered job recommendations based on user skills (sentence-transformers + cosine similarity).
- **Admin** — Platform stats, user management, recruiter approval/rejection.
- **Rate limiting** — Auth routes limited to 10 requests per 15 minutes per IP.
- **Security** — Helmet, CORS, XSS sanitization, input validation, mongo-sanitize.
- **Swagger docs** — Interactive API docs at `/api-docs`.
- **Tests** — Jest integration test suite with MongoDB in-memory server.

## AI Features

Three HuggingFace-powered features are integrated into the platform:

### 1. Job Category Classification
**Model:** `facebook/bart-large-mnli` (zero-shot classification)

When a recruiter posts or updates a job, the title and description are sent to HuggingFace. The model classifies the job into one of: `Backend`, `Frontend`, `AI/ML`, `DevOps`, `Data Engineering`, `Mobile`, `Security`, or `Other` — automatically, no manual tagging needed.

### 2. Skill Extraction from Bio
**Model:** `dslim/bert-base-NER` (Named Entity Recognition)

Job seekers write a bio and hit the extract-skills endpoint. The NER model scans the text and pulls out technical skills and tools (e.g. React, Python, Docker). These are saved to the user's profile and used for recommendations.

### 3. AI Job Recommendations
**Model:** `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (sentence embeddings)

When a job seeker requests recommendations, their skills are encoded into a vector. All open jobs are also encoded. Cosine similarity is computed between the user vector and each job vector, and the top matches are returned ranked by relevance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- MongoDB Atlas URI (or local MongoDB)
- HuggingFace API token
- Gmail account with App Password (for OTP emails)
- Cloudinary account (for profile pictures)

### Local Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Sanad-Manga/GIU-Nexus.git
cd GIU-Nexus

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your values in .env

# 4. Start the server
npm run dev
```

Server runs on `http://localhost:5000`. Swagger docs at `http://localhost:5000/api-docs`.

### Docker Setup

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

Starts the API and a local MongoDB container together. API available at `http://localhost:5000`.

npm test
```

Uses an in-memory MongoDB instance — no external DB required. Covers auth, jobs, applications, profile, rate limiting, and OTP flows.

---

## Seeding the Database

```bash
npm run seed
```

Creates sample users, jobs, and applications for development.
